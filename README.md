- ImageRecognition - Illgal Mining Detection

    The project focuses on detecting illegal mining activities using satellite images. A neural network is employed to label unannotated image chips with information about weather conditions and land uses. However, the challenge arises from the rare 'artisanal mine' class, representing less than 1% of the data. To overcome this hurdle, the project utilizes techniques like data augmentation and dehazing. The overall aim is to enhance environmental insights and contribute to addressing deforestation challenges globally.
