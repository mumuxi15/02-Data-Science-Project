## Introduction

Peer-to-peer lending platforms like Lending Club is reshaping the way individuals and small businesses access loans. Borrowers simply submit an application online and the platform will use a proprietary model to determine the interest rate of the approved loans to whom the algorithm believes has a good chance paying back. Lending Club facilitates direct lending between investors and borrowers, cutting out traditional financial intermediaries. While this democratization of lending has expanded opportunities for borrowers, it has also posed new challenges, particularly concerning the risk of loan defaults. 

The goal is to delve into the realm of Lending Club loan default prediction using the power of machine learning. Specifically, we aim to build an application to assist investors in their quest to evaluate the risk associated with individual loan applications accurately.  Our ultimate focus is on enhancing investment return rates by minimizing the default risk.

## Analysis

We randomly select 10% of the population data as sample and performed some basic data analysis to gain a better insight to the data. 

In the correlation heat map below the red hues implies a positive correlation, whereas blue hues indicate a negative correlation. Borrowers with elevated credit scores, higher annual income, and extended work experience demonstrate a higher likelihood of repaying loans. Conversely, there is a negative correlation with borrowed amounts, debt-to-income ratios, the number of inquiries in the last 6 months, and accounts currently delinquent.

From the heat map, we had some basic understanding of the numeric columns but how about categorical columns ?
