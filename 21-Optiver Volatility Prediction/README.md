#### Kaggle: Optiver Realized Volatility Prediction

Team: Penny and Thomas

##### Project description

Optiver is dedicated to continuously improving financial markets, creating better access and prices for options, ETFs, cash equities, bonds and foreign currencies on numerous exchanges around the world. Optiverâ€™s teams have spent countless hours building sophisticated models that predict volatility and continuously generate fairer options prices for end investors. However, an industry-leading pricing algorithm can never stop evolving, and there is no better place than Kaggle to help Optiver take its model to the next level.

##### Project Goal

Build models that predict short-term volatility for hundreds of stocks across different sectors. Data includes hundreds of millions of rows of highly granular financial data at your fingertips, with which needs to be designed to forecast volatility over 10-minute periods. Evaluated against real market data collected in the three-month evaluation period after training.
